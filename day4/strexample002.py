A method is also a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task.
Crucially, it's associated with an object (an instance of a class).
You call a method on an object using dot notation (object.method()).
Methods automatically receive the object they are called on as their first argument (conventionally named self). This allows the method to access and modify the object's data.
